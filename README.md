# Class Website Project

These are mostly parts of the website that I have worked on, such as creating the database outside the project, as well as allowing the client to access the database and make changes.

I was also responsible for the dogpage, which allows one to search and watch the videos that they are allowed access to, as well as allow admins to create excel spreadsheets of data they may want to save and automatically download the spreadsheet onto their computer.

To view this website, the in development site may be accessed at https://csmaster.sxu.edu/1pet1vet/login.php as long as it is still up
